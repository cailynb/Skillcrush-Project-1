            <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
             <div class="half-width">
                 <p>After living in Columbia Missouri for 8 years, I moved to California to get 
                     my degree in Commercial Music- Vocal Performance- songwriting and singing are my main passions.
                    However, because starting out as a performer is... well... less than stable, I spent the past
                    few months, after graduating college, to search for a career that I enjoyed as much as I did music, and that could
                    financially support my desired lifestyle and important hobbies like singing and songwriting. However, never in my life
                    would I have imagined I would find such a career in the Tech industry!
                 </p>

                <p>Before starting my tech journey, I was in a vicious cycle of finding an interest
                    that I could pursue as a career, doing as much research on it as humanly possible, then immediately losing
                    interest, as quickly as I had gained it. I was worried I would never find a job that I could have true joy in doing.
                    But after learning more about code and about being a Front-End Developer, I found out that this career had
                    the structure, organization, versatility, and constant learning I wanted in a job. And not only that, but it could support my introversion
                    by giving me the option of working remotely and freedom to continue persuing music- the dream!
                     Ever since I started learning the beauty of code, I haven't looked back! I can't imagine doing anything
                    else career-wise.</p>
